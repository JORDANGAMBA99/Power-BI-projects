# Bike Share Dashboard

We need you to develop a bike share dashboard that indicates key performance metrics for informed decision making 

## Problem Statement
You have been tasked by a Bike company to come up with the a dashboard that shows the following target variables:
- Hourly revenue
- Profit and revenue analysis
- Seasonal Revenue
- Rider demographics

## Technology Used
 - Power BI
   
## Step 1 Data Extraction from Postgresql Database
- Create a Database in Postgresql for the bike_share_yr_0,bike_share_yr_1 and  also the cost_table

```
## Create a database that will contain bike_share_yr_0
create table bike_share_yr_0(
dteday	varchar(60),
season	smallint,
yr	smallint,
mnth	smallint,
hr	smallint,
holiday	smallint,
weekday	smallint,
workingday	smallint,
weathersit	smallint,
temp	numeric(5,4),
atemp	numeric(5,4),
hum	numeric(5,4),
windspeed	numeric(5,4),
rider_type	varchar(20),
riders smallint
) 
## Import the data from the bike_share_yr_0.csv file
copy bike_share_yr_0
from 'C:\Data Analysis Projects\Power BI projects\SQL and Power BI\bike_share_yr_0.csv'
with(format csv,header)
select * from bike_share_yr_0

## Create a database that will contain bike_share_yr_1
create table bike_share_yr_1(
dteday	varchar(60),
season	smallint,
yr	smallint,
mnth	smallint,
hr	smallint,
holiday	smallint,
weekday	smallint,
workingday	smallint,
weathersit	smallint,
temp	numeric(5,4),
atemp	numeric(5,4),
hum	numeric(5,4),
windspeed	numeric(5,4),
rider_type	varchar(20),
riders smallint
)

## Import the data from the bike_share_yr_1.csv file
copy bike_share_yr_1
from 'C:\Data Analysis Projects\Power BI projects\SQL and Power BI\bike_share_yr_1.csv'
with(format csv,header)

Create a database that will contain cost_table
create table cost_table(
yr smallint,
price numeric(5,4),
COGS numeric(5,4)
)

# Import the data from the cost_table
copy cost_table
from 'C:\Data Analysis Projects\Power BI projects\SQL and Power BI\cost_table.csv'
with(format csv,header)
```
- From the existing data union the bike share data, create a CTE from the bike share data and also join the combined bike share data with the cost table calculate the revenue and also the profit
```
## create a CTE and union both the bike share data sets
with cte as (
select * from bike_share_yr_1
union all
select * from bike_share_yr_1)
select *from cte

with cte as (
select * from bike_share_yr_1
union all
select * from bike_share_yr_1)

# join the cost table to the bike share data
select 
dteday,
season,
a.yr,
weekday,
hr,
rider_type,
riders,
price,
COGS
from cte a
left join cost_table b
on a.yr = b.yr

with cte as (
select * from bike_share_yr_1
union all
select * from bike_share_yr_0)

select 
dteday,
season,
a.yr,
weekday,
hr,
rider_type,
riders,
price,
COGS,
riders*price as revenue,
(riders*price) - (COGS) as profit
from cte a
left join cost_table b
on a.yr = b.yr

with cte as(select * from bike_share_yr_0
union all
select * from bike_share_yr_1)

## Calculate the revenue and the profit for the riders
select 
dteday,
season,
a.yr,
weekday,
hr,
rider_type,
riders,
price,
COGS,
riders*price as revenue,
riders*price - COGS*riders as profit
from cte a
left join cost_table b
on a.yr = b.yr
```
## Step 2 Loading the queries into the Power BI database

## Step 3 Data Cleaning and Exploration
- The data is clean thus no need for any data cleaning
- We also need to add a dax measure in order to calculate the profit margin
 ``` 
  Profit Margin = (SUM('Main Query'[revenue])- (sum('Main Query'[profit]))/SUM('Main Query'[profit]))

```
## Step 4 Full dashboard

## Recommendations
Conservative Increase : Considering the substantial increase last year, a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range of 10-15% could test the marketâ€™s response without rising a significant loss of customers.

Conduct a Price Setting:
-	If the price in 2022 wa 4.99$ a 10% increae wold make the new price about 5.99$
-	A 15%  increae would set the price at approximately 5.74$
  
### Recommended Strategy

Market Analysis : Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction,potential competitive changes and the overall economic environment.This can guide whether leaning towards the lower or higher end of the suggested increase.

Segmented Pricing Strategy: Consider different pricing for casual registered users as they may have different price  sensitivities
Monitor and Adjust: Implement the new prices but be  ready to adjust based on immediate customer feedaback and sales data. Monitoring closely will allow you to fine tune your pricing strategy without fully to a price that might turn out to be too high.
