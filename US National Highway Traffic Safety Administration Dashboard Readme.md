## US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Dashboard
- You have been commissioned by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to create a dashboard.

### Problem Statement
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has tasked you with developing a data-driven dashboard that visually represents the trends in road safety across various states from 2007 to 2018. 
The goal is to analyze and display the progress made towards the NHTSA's target of reducing fatalities to 1.02 per 100,000,000 miles driven.

To achieve this, you will utilize the dataset provided in the "PA - Driving Safety" spreadsheet from the "PowerBIData" workbook. 
This dataset includes key variables such as the state, year, miles traveled, actual fatalities, fatalities per 100,000,000 miles, the target fatality rate, and the actual fatalities per 100,000,000 miles for the year 2018.

The dashboard should effectively convey:
- Trends in road safety over the specified time period for each state.
- The comparison between actual fatalities and the target fatality rate.
- The progress made by each state by the end of 2018.
- This dashboard will be used by NHTSA to assess the effectiveness of road safety initiatives and to identify areas where further improvement is needed.
